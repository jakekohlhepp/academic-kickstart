I am an assistant professor of economics and the John Stewart Fellow at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am an applied microeconomist with a background in theory and labor. My CV is available [here](files/kohlhepp_cv.pdf). 

My research agenda focuses on how human resource decisions within firms shape markets, but this is more of a common thread than a rule. I believe an idea is worth pursuing if it feels like magic and truth at the same time.

**NEWS:**  My paper ["The Inner Beauty of Firms"](https://www.jkohlhepp.com/publication/organizations/) was awarded [the Oliver Williamson Best Conference Paper Award](https://sioe.org/news/inner-beauty-firms-organization-matters) by the Society of Institutional and organizational Economics.
