I am a PhD candidate in economics at UCLA. I am an applied microeconomist with a background in theory and labor. My research agenda focuses on how human resource decisions within firms shape markets.

I am on the job market during the 2022-2023 academic year.

My CV is available [here](files/kohlhepp_cv.pdf). My job market paper is available [here](files/kohlhepp_jmp.pdf).

I am a proud husband and father. My wife and I write a blog where we summarize each week of our marriage [here](https://www.thekohlhepps.com).
