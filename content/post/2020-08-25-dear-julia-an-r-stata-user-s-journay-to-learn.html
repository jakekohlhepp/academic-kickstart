<p>I began auditing Tyler Ransom’s structural econometrics course this week. part of the course involves learning to use Julia. I have heard the rumors about Julia’s fantastic speed, so I have decided to really try and learn the language!</p>
<p>I will be documenting my experiences in subsequents posts. The focus will be on how Julia compares in style to R and STATA, the two languages I currently use.</p>
