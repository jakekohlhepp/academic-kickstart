I study how the assignment of workers to tasks within firms interacts with labor and product markets using data from a management software company. The data allow me to observe the assignment of millions of tasks to workers across hundreds of hair salons. I develop a measure of organizational complexity, which captures the amount of information required to implement a given task assignment. I show complexity varies significantly across salons, and more complex salons have higher revenues, employees, prices and return customers. Based on these facts, I develop a structural model where oligopolistic firms choose their internal structure subject to heterogeneous organization costs. In the model, firms choose more complex assignments in order to increase product quality by better matching workers with multidimensional skills to tasks. Because firms compete in both the product and labor market, internal organization shapes and is shaped by wages, product prices and product qualities. I prove identification of firm-specific organization costs and provide a computationally light estimation algorithm. I estimate the model for Manhattan hair salons and study a counterfactual sales tax cut and a minimum wage increase. Internal organization plays a key role in determining the distributional impact of these policies.
