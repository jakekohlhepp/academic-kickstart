Pricing decisions are crucial for managing a firm's reputation and maximizing profits. Consumer reviews reflect both the product quality and its price, with more favorable reviews being left when a product is priced lower. We study whether such review behavior can induce a firm to manipulate the review process by underpricing its product, or pricing it below current consumers' willingness to pay. We introduce an equilibrium model with a privately informed firm repeatedly selling its product to uninformed but rational consumers who learn about the quality of the product from past reviews and current prices. We show that underpricing can arise only when the firm reputation is low and then only under a specific condition on consumers' taste shock distribution, which we fully characterize. Rating manipulation unambiguously benefits consumers, because it operates via underpricing.
