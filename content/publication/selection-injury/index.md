abstract = "Workplace injury carries a large economic and human cost, yet little is known about how individual behavior impacts aggregate injury rates. This paper explores the role injury risk plays in labor supply decisions using the daily pay and workersâ€™ compensation records of 553 Los Angeles traffic officers over a 21 month period. The leave of coworkers and the size of an officerâ€™s network are used to identify how people with different injury propensity select into work. Officers supply more labor when they are less likely to be injured. Self-selection into work leads to large reductions in aggregate injury risk: the estimated population injury rate is 8.5 times larger than the injury rate observed among shifts worked. The results imply that mechanisms which assign shifts to those who value them most will reduce aggregate injury rates. Model estimates are used to compute the value of a statistical injury, which for Los Angeles traffic officers is between $11,710 and $23,419."
