 Tips represent an important part of compensation for many American workers. Understanding whether tips incentivize service quality is critical for deciding whether tips should be treated di erently than wages under tax and minimum-wage laws. For tipping to be incentive relevant, average tips must be positively correlated with service quality. I develop a test for incentive relevant tipping that consists of a simple regression of rst-time tip percentages on an indicator for whether a customer returns in the future. A positive coe cient reveals either a behavioral quality-based tipping norm, rational forward-looking relational incentives or both. I implement the test using more than 200,000 rst-time tips from the beauty industry, a setting where the test is high-powered because customers return to the same worker 30.7% of the time. I nd no evidence that tipping is incentive relevant, even when the test is conducted among customers visiting the same worker. Across 2,953 workers, I fail to reject incentive-irrelevant tipping in 98.5% of cases. I instead nd evidence that social norms play a role. As an example, 31.2% of rst-time tips are exactly 20%, the likely default of the default built into the management software. Among customers with an observed second tip who tipped 20% during their rst visit, 63.0% also tipped exactly 20% during their second visit.
