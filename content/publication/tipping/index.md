abstract = "Tipping represents a large part of U.S. economic activity. An open question is whether it has a meaningful impact on economic outcomes. Does tipping shape incentives and welfare or is it just a transfer based on a social norms? We answer this question by using a novel data set recording tips left by clients for customers. We develop a simple conceptual framework which allows us to test whether tipping is economically meaningful. In contract to previous results, we find evidence that tipping is quality dependent yet not connected to dynamic incentives."
