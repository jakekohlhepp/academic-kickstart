abstract = "We analyze how delegating recruitment influences the search for talent. During search, the recruiter does not learn worker productivity but only forms a belief characterized by an expectation and a variance. We demonstrate that delegation is equivalent to making the search technology less accurate. Delegation results in moral hazard with a multitasking flavor, where the recruiter wastes effort finding low-variance workers at the expense of high-expectation workers. As workers become more homogeneous with respect to productivity variance delegation becomes more efficient. Our model provides a theoretical connection between delegation and variance-based statistical discrimination."
