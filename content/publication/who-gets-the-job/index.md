abstract = "A firm hires a recruiter to find a worker. Search over candidates is noisy:  the recruiter does not know productivity exactly  but  instead  forms an  estimate  of  a  workerâ€™s  productivity  expectation  and variance.  We analyze how delegation under the commonly used refund contract between the firm and the recruiter affects search. We find the contract induces hiring mismatch, where the recruiter focuses on finding low variance instead of high expected productivity workers. More heterogeneity in worker productivity variance causes greater hiring mismatch and welfare loss. Our model predicts variance-based statistical discrimination in hiring like that suggested by the Heckman-Siegalman critique. We also analyze the relationship between direct and delegated search, establishing delegation is equivalent to adding noise to the search technology."
